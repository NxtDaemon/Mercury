# Mercury
Within messing around with HTB/Boot2Root machines I often need to serve up WinPEAS or LinEnum. to streamline this Mercury gives you options on What methods you can choose to transfer files, Additionally it allows presets to be made to make things quicker. 
### Transfer Methods
- Python Updog HTTP server (can be modified to use HTTPS)
- Impacket SMB server [Current Not Working!!]
- FTP (Using pyftpdlib)
- Raw Socket Transfer
